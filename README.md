# AlgoCasts

Companion repo to a course on Udemy.com

This is a compilation of my responses to alogorithm problems that were presented in a udemy course by Stephen Grider

The Course is all about Data Structures and algorithms and contains a set of unit tests for each execrise

This is a huge collection of common algorithm questions, including everything from 'reversing a string' to 'determine the width of a BST'

All solutions are written in JavaScript (ECMA-2015+)
And all tests are run using Jest
